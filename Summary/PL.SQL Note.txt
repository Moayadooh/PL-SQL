DCL (Data Control Language)
TCL (Transaction Control Language)

DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, SELECT
DCL: GRANT, REVOKE privileges
TCL: COMMIT, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK

Select statements
Aggregate functions
Operators (arithmetic, relational or comparison, logical)
sub-queries
set operators
joins (inner, outer, self, cross)
grouping data, having clause
managing data in different timezones

Database Architecture:
Oracle 11g Database = Single instance having one database only.
Oracle server = Instance + Database
Instance = Memory structures (SGA) + Background Processes

Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express Console is web based tool used by DBAs to monitor CDB and PDBs.

Categories of data:
-----------------------
1. Structured Data: when data is in a standardized format, has a well-defined structure, complies to a data model.
    Example: Excel files
    Datatypes: BLOB

2. Unstructured Data: data that doesn't fit in a spreadsheet with rows and columns.
    Example: video
    Datatypes: BLOB

3. Semi-structured Data: data that does not conform to a data model but has some structure.
    Example: emails, XML
    Datatypes: VARCHAR

4. Spatial Data: any type of data that directly or indirectly references a specific geographical area or location.
    Example: geometric data in floor plans.
    Datatypes: SDO_GEOMETRY
	
The MERGE statement selects rows from one table to update or insert into another table. 
The decision whether to update or insert into the target table is based on a condition in the ON clause.
Note: MERGE is a deterministic statement. 
That is, you cannot update the same row of the target table multiple times in the same MERGE statement. 
You must have INSERT and UPDATE object privileges on the target table and SELECT privilege on the source table.

Complex Views: A view that is created from more than one table.

Primary key vs Unique key:
- Both of them contain unique values only, that means, no duplicate data in these columns which are declared as PK Or UNIQUE.
- Primary key-one per table
- Unique key - many per table
- Primary key is NOT NULL by default
- Unique key can contain NULL values
- Unique keys are not linked to other tables.
- Primary key is INDEXED by default.

what is the purpose of indexing?
to speed up searches in the tables.






Stages before code executed:
1- syntax check (parse)
2- permession check
3- compile
4- execute

in Procedures the first 3 stages are already done only we execute which result in imroved performacne

RMI --> Remote Method Invocation (Java)
RPC --> Remote Procedure call (Procedures)

OLTP: Online Transaction Processing
e,g; airline, banking, manpower, stock market, healthcare, hospitality
Huge amount of DML every second
need WRITE performance

OLAP: Online Analytics Processing
e,g. DSS
need READ performance
